# Project-CS180

This project incorporates a user interface with a database where users can explore the functionality of the database and filter and select data based on what they need. 
The database consists of movies where users can filter for categories such as genre, gross revenue, directors, stars and more. Furthermore, users can add their selected 
to a collection they make on their local environment which they can use for their own purpose. This functionality goes deeper as the filters will output not only the
selected information but the respective counterparts of that information. Users can modify the information in the database as desired and add to their own collection
for whatever purpose. Users can input individual rows of information or a whole database at once which will be incorporated with the current database.
